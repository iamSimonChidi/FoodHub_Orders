This is the third challenge in he Data Analytics Super League competition I participated. This challenge is a team challenge. I was placed in Team 7 alongside three other wonderful data analysts. It was an interesting moment of working with other team members.
## Introduction
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.
## Objective

They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered.
